# Detection-of-Malware-using-Machine-Learning-based-on-API-calls

The detection of malware presents a significant and continually evolving chal-
lenge in cybersecurity, as attackers adeptly refine their tactics to bypass conventional
detection methods. A promising avenue in addressing this issue is the utilization of
machine learning algorithms to analyze patterns of API calls, which are frequently
employed by malware to interact with a host system. The primary objective of
this research project is to design, develop, and evaluate the performance of various
machine learning models, specifically Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision
Tree algorithms, for the detection of malware based on sequences of API calls. To
achieve this, comprehensive API call sequences from known malware samples and
benign software will be collected and meticulously preprocessed to extract relevant
features. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of these
machine learning algorithms in effectively identifying and classifying malware
based on API call sequences, thereby enhancing the capability of cybersecurity
systems to detect and mitigate malware threats. Furthermore, by integrating ad-
vanced machine learning techniques into the malware detection process, the project
seeks to stay ahead of the evolving tactics employed by cyber attackers. As cyber
threats continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, it is imperative for
cybersecurity technologies to evolve in tandem. Through rigorous experimentation,
evaluation, and optimization, the project aims to contribute to the development of
cutting-edge solutions that can adapt and respond effectively to emerging malware
threats. Ultimately, the project endeavors to empower security professionals with
state-of-the-art tools and methodologies to safeguard systems and networks against
the ever-present and evolving challenges posed by malicious actors in the digital
realm
